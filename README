This is a Matlab toolbox intented to demonstrate the principles behind
2d mesochronic analyses for incompressible dynamical systems.

** Installation: **

The code compiles itself correctly upon the first run in serial (non-parallel) Matlab. So this step can be skipped if code is always to be run in serial mode.

To run in parallel, in the folder containing mcjacobian.prj first run:
   deploytool -build mcjacobian.prj % wait until "Build finished." is output
which will compile matlab code into C, improving the speed of computation.

** Test (demo) system **
This is a simple planar, time-dependent flow, 
used as the first example in
Mezic, Loire, et al. Science (2010)

The demonstration is a sample short-time run, just to evaluate that the code runs validly and to familiarize the user with inputs and output. An end-user 
would (at first) mimic fourgyre.m, and either 
a) replace the vector field 
b) replace the evaluations of Jacobian of the vector field along trajectory	points

Demo: fourgyre.m

% open parallel jobs
matlabpool open; % 

% computes mesochronic analysis
% and store results in mcan_fourgyre_ode_fwdT_1.5_N_00900.mat
R = fourgyre([], [0.5, 1, 1.5], 30, 1) 

% visualize output for T=1
fourgyre(R, 1, 30, 1) 

*** File functionality ***

* Main files *

  abcslice.m -- Demo; Can be used as a model for how analysis should
  			    be performed and visualized

  meh_simulation.m -- Harness: this is the main file that performs
  simulation and analysis of an arbitrary system

  meh2d.m -- Takes a mesochronic Jacobian and computes quantifiers and
  classification for 2d flows

* Computational aides *

  evaluateJ_ode.m -- Evaluates the mesochronic Jacobian at a given
  state point and time of a flow.

  mcjacobian.m -- Computes a mesochronic Jacobian from evaluations of
  			      instantaneous Jacobian along trajectory
  				  (run by evaluateJ_ode.m)

  ftle.m -- Computes FTLE from mesochronic Jacobian (run by
  meh2d).

  jacobian_fd.m -- Computes instantaneous Jacobiaian using central
  difference method on a vector field.

  matpolys.m -- Computes characteristic and minimal polynomials of a
  matrix.

  mindist.m -- Computes the smallest difference of elements of a
  vector.


* Visualization aides *

  mehcolor.m -- Creates a colormap for visualization of 2d mesochronic
  classes using values of determinant.

  diverging_map.m -- Creates a diverging colormap between 2
  					 colors. Written by Andy Stein based on Kenneth
  					 Moreland (Sandia) paper:
